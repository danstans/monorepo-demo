# Capable Pacemaker

Pacemaker is a Design System, Guidelines and Component Library responsible for keeping Capable projects and products thriving. Both this document and the actual artifacts are a living system that aims to be evolving incrementally and often.

## Principles

- **Set up for change**. The changes to the system should never be dreaded. Small, incremental changes should never be expensive to make. The properties that are built with the system should support this philosophy.
- **Highly atomic** - The individual components of the system should be as simple and generic as possible - highly composed components limit reusability
- **Visually low level** - The system should be recognizable at the level of typography and spacing, to make sure we have flexible theming options
